      "response": "A derivative in calculus represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable. For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) at a point x=a is defined as the limit of [f(a+h) - f(a)]/h as h approaches 0. It’s used to find slopes of tangents, optimize functions, and analyze motion.",
